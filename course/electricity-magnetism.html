          <div class="div-item" id="div0">
            Calculus, originally called infinitesimal calculus or “the calculus
            of infinitesimals”, is the mathematical study of continuous change,
            in the same way, that geometry is the study of shape and algebra is
            the study of generalizations of arithmetic operations. <br>
            It has two major branches, differential calculus and integral calculus;
            the former concerns instantaneous rates of change, and the slopes of
            curves, while integral calculus concerns the accumulation of quantities
            and areas under or between curves. These two branches are related to
            each other by the fundamental theorem of calculus, and they make use
            of the fundamental notions of convergence of infinite sequences and
            infinite series to a well-defined limit. <br><br>
            Lectures of this course were given every Friday from 8:00 pm to 9:30
            pm, starting from 3 April 2020 to 29 May 2020.  The course was taught
            online under <a href="https://fermionku.com">Fermion Physics Club</a>
            via Zoom, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. <br>
            The live lectures were recorded and uploaded to YouTube. Students
            received information about how to attend the classes via messenger
