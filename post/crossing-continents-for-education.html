        Studying for a graduate degree in the United States can be an exciting and rewarding experience,
        but it can also be daunting, especially for students from Bangladesh. The application process,
        visa requirements, and cultural adjustments can be challenging to navigate.
        <br><br>

        Hello! I'm Md Abdus Sami Akanda, a Bangladeshi PhD student in Physics at the University of
        Nebraska-Lincoln. While I haven't conquered the academic frontier entirely, I'm here to share
        valuable lessons and practical tips from my journey to help you navigate the US graduate school
        system and achieve your own academic triumphs.
        <br><br>

        Now, let's delve into the details step by step and unpack this journey together.
        <br><br>

        <h3>Charting Your Course</h3>

        <b>Identify your field of passion:</b> Discovering what truly ignites your neurons is the key
        to finding your PhD sweet spot! Move beyond the broad strokes of your BSc/MSc achievements and
        zero in on a niche subfield - whether it's Solid State Physics, Spintronics, Photonics, or
        Nuclear Physics. If you're unsure, don't worry; apply anyway! Professors appreciate enthusiastic
        explorers, and your passion for a specific topic can make your application stand out. You can
        always adjust your academic path to align with your evolving passions, even after admission.
        <br><br>

        <b>Research universities and programs:</b> With your academic compass pointing north, discover
        the PhD program that ignites your research passion. Use
        <a href="https://www.topuniversities.com/" target="_blank" class="post-url"><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i> Top Universities</a>
        as your guide for research hotspots and rankings, while
        <a href="https://chat.openai.com/" target="_blank" class="post-url"><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i> ChatGPT</a>
        helps compare vibes and opportunities. Connect with fellow students at the universities or the
        program for insider insights, but trust your gut. Choose the program that makes your neurons
        dance for your perfect academic adventure.
        <br><br>

        <b>Create a Google Sheet:</b> Forget juggling a million tabs on your browser - organize your
        PhD quest with one master spreadsheet! Track universities, programs, deadlines, and more,
        all neatly lined up in your Google Sheet. This ain't no pre-made template, this is your
        personalized PhD command center. Here is my template:
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gNg7O0dgibRxMQGBG9cggLlpmglhJ2uh3xtfqoBrX6I/edit?usp=sharing" class="post-url"><i class="fa-solid fa-sheet-plastic"></i> University List - Template</a>.
        Copy it, customize it, and conquer the application process like a boss.
        <br><br>

        <h3>Preparing for Standardized Tests</h3>

        <b>Obtain a valid passport:</b> Ensure you possess a valid passport before registering for
        standardized tests, as it is a mandatory requirement. Additionally, keep in mind that
        traveling to the USA is not possible without a passport. Prioritize obtaining or renewing
        your passport to meet both the testing and potential travel requirements. For guidelines
        on obtaining a Bangladeshi passport, refer to the following url:
        <a href="https://www.epassport.gov.bd/instructions/instructions" target="_blank" class="post-url"><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i> E-Passport Online Registration Portal</a>.
        <br><br>

        <b>Conquer the GRE:</b> While an outstanding score can serve as a formidable asset, ascertain
        whether the program requires the test in the first place to avoid expending cognitive
        resources on unnecessary endeavors. Seek guidance from the Fermion Physics Club's informative
        video on GRE:
        <a href="https://youtu.be/m78Jzz2xACU?si=IUGdRg60uTHAX68d" class="post-url"><i class="fa-brands fa-youtube"></i> Guidelines on GRE</a>,
        Subsequently, hone your focus, ensure adequate mental acuity, and approach the GRE with the
        intent to master it, recognizing that a robust score is not merely a numerical representation
        but a strategic asset in your academic arsenal.
        <br><br>

        <b>Master TOEFL or IELTS:</b> Achieving success in your desired program requires an English
        proficiency certificate, with the choice between IELTS or TOEFL depending on program
        requirements. Investigate the entry criteria of your chosen program and then diligently
        prepare your language proficiency at home. While mock exams at a test center serve as
        your boot camp, if you possess linguistic prowess, independent preparation is also an option.
        Fermion Physics Club has your intel for IELTS:
        <a href="https://youtu.be/Kl9trpPC6a8?si=xuROYBUaANcVCp9s" class="post-url"><i class="fa-brands fa-youtube"></i> Guidelines on IELTS</a>
        & TOEFL: <a href="https://youtu.be/qeeW2fqyMcs?si=LZ_-01Q4f6rk3wUs" class="post-url"><i class="fa-brands fa-youtube"></i> Guidelines on TOEFL</a>.
        Conquer these tests to showcase your academic fluency.
        <br><br>

        <b>Plan your test dates:</b> Strategically schedule your IELTS or TOEFL exam, aligning
        it with program deadlines. Avoid procrastination, as decisive action is key to ensuring
        success in your academic endeavors.
        <br><br>

        <h3>Gathering Your Academic Credentials</h3>

        <b>Obtain official transcripts:</b> Obtain official transcripts from every institution
        you've traversed, starting from your bachelor degree. Create scanned digital copy of
        those transcripts for instant access, especially for the applications. Your transcripts
        are your academic map, showcasing your journey and unlocking doors to program paradise.
        <br><br>

        <b>Request an endorsed copy:</b> Ensure your transcripts carry the official endorsement
        and seal from the administrative staff; these are essential for university admission,
        with some institutions requiring them during the application process. You may need to
        personally deliver them to your university or use courier services such as DHL Express
        or FedEx for submission.
        <br><br>

        <h3>Securing Strong Recommendations</h3>

        <b>Choose professors who know you well:</b> When choosing professors for recommendation
        letters, prioritize individuals who can offer profound insights into your academic
        capabilities and future potential. Opt for educators who are not only acquainted with
        your coursework but also have a keen understanding of your intellectual strengths,
        personal growth, and aspirations. Their recommendations should reflect a comprehensive
        perspective on your academic journey, enriching your application with authentic and
        compelling endorsements.
        <br><br>

        <b>Draft a template (optional):</b> Provide a succinct template outlining your academic
        achievements and research interests to assist your recommenders. Summarize key
        milestones and projects, ensuring clarity on your areas of study. This guide serves
        as a roadmap for recommenders to craft letters that align with your goals, enhancing
        the authenticity and relevance of their endorsements.
        <br><br>

        <b>Request letters well in advance:</b> Ensure your recommenders have the time required
        to craft meaningful and impactful letters that truly highlight your strengths and
        accomplishments. This investment in time allows for a more thorough exploration of
        your qualifications, enhancing the authenticity and effectiveness of their recommendations.
        <br><br>

        <b>Provide your CV, SOP, and course information</b> Equip your recommenders with essential
        materials such as your CV, Statement of Purpose (SOP), and academic transcripts. Sharing
        this pertinent information ensures that they have a comprehensive understanding of your
        academic and professional background, enabling them to write compelling and tailored
        letters of recommendation.
        <br><br>

        <h3>Crafting a Compelling Curriculum Vitae and Statement of Purpose</h3>

        <b>Create an competent CV:</b> Set your CV apart by crafting a simple yet impactful
        document. Emphasize authenticity, showcasing your unique skills and experiences.
        Highlight relevant academic achievements, research projects, and extracurricular
        activities to ensure your qualifications stand out. Check out my CV here:

        Customize it to fashion your own CV and make it uniquely yours.
        <br><br>

        <b>Draft your own SOP:</b> When crafting your Statement of Purpose (SOP), resist the
        temptation to rely on ChatGPT and avoid peeking at others' SOPs. Instead, meticulously
        draft it on your own, following the steps below for each paragraph:

        <ul>
          <li>Opening Statement</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Clearly, state the reason you're writing the SOP for.</li>
            <blockquote>
              "I am writing to express my desire to get a PhD in the field of 'A' at the
              University of 'B'. I grew my strong desire during my 'omuk experience' and
              have been developing myself since then."
            </blockquote>
          </ul>
          <li>Introduction:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Begin with a compelling introduction that succinctly outlines your academic journey.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Academic Background</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Discuss your academic achievements and highlight any notable coursework.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Research Interests</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Detail the specific courses that have influenced your research interests and align with your academic goals.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Skills and Proficiencies</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Showcase the skills and proficiencies you have acquired through your academic pursuits.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Professional Experiences</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Provide insights into your professional experiences and their impact on your academic trajectory.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Co-curricular Involvement</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Highlight relevant co-curricular activities that complement your academic and career aspirations.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Why This Program/University</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Articulate why you are drawn to the specific program and university, emphasizing the alignment with your goals.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Future Aspirations</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Clearly outline your aspirations and what you aim to achieve through the program.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Conclusion</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Conclude with a final paragraph summarizing your key points and expressing your enthusiasm for the academic journey ahead.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        
        Remember, each paragraph should be cohesive, contributing to a comprehensive and authentic
        narrative of your academic and professional trajectory. Try to get feedbacks on your SOP
        from experts. The process is iterative, so continuously refine your SOP to your satisfaction,
        ensuring it authentically reflects your journey and ambitions.
        <br><br>

        <h3>Navigating the Application Process</h3>

        <b>Fill out applications online:</b> Completing online applications is a crucial step in the
        admission process. To ensure a smooth and accurate submission, carefully follow the
        instructions provided by each university. Pay attention to specific requirements, such
        as document uploads, transcripts, SOP, CV, test scores, and recommendation letters.
        Double-check for any supplementary materials or additional steps unique to each institution.
        Adhering closely to the guidelines demonstrates your attention to detail and commitment
        to the application process, increasing your chances of a successful submission.
        <br><br>

        <b>Pay application fees:</b> Be prepared to pay the required application fees for each
        university. Take the time to explore potential waiver options that may be available.
        Some institutions offer fee waivers based on financial need, participation in certain
        programs, or other criteria. Investigate these possibilities to minimize financial
        barriers and ensure that the application fee does not pose an obstacle. Be sure to
        adhere to any specific instructions provided by the university regarding fee payment
        and waiver requests to streamline the application procedure.
        <br><br>

        <h3>Bracing Yourself for the Selection Process and Interviews</h3>

        <b>Stay patient:</b> Given the duration of the selection process, which can extend over
        several months, it's imperative to maintain a mindset of patience and persistence.
        Understand that these timelines are inherent to the thorough evaluation of applications,
        and embrace the waiting period with a determined and unwavering focus on your academic
        goals. 
        <br><br>

        <b>Prepare for potential interviews:</b> Prepare for potential interviews by thoroughly
        researching the program, ensuring readiness to discuss your academic background, research
        interests, and career goals. Familiarize yourself with your BSc/MSc syllabus, anticipating
        fundamental questions, and be prepared to present slides on your research if applicable.
        Understand the specific nuances of the program to articulate how your aspirations align
        seamlessly with their offerings. This proactive approach not only demonstrates your
        commitment but also positions you confidently for successful interviews.
        <br><br>

        <h3>Securing Your Finances</h3>

        <b>Accept your offer letter and request an I-20 form:</b> Once you receive your offer
        letter, take the necessary steps to officially accept it. Concurrently, initiate the
        process to request the issuance of an I-20 form, a crucial document in obtaining your
        student visa. The I-20 form serves as a key component in the visa application process,
        facilitating a seamless transition as you embark on your academic journey. Ensure you
        adhere to the guidelines and timelines provided by the university to facilitate a
        smooth and timely visa acquisition.
        <br><br>

        <h3>Conquering the Student Visa (F-1 Visa)</h3>

        <b>Initiate visa application:</b> Begin by creating an account and completing the
        <a href="https://ceac.state.gov/genniv/" target="_blank" class="post-url"><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i> DS-160 form</a>,
        providing essential details according to your passport for your U.S. visa application.
        Details about the application can be found on this page:
        <a href="https://www.ustraveldocs.com/bd/bd-niv-typefandm.asp" target="_blank" class="post-url"><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i> Apply for a U.S. Visa | Student Visa - Bangladesh (English)</a>.
        <br><br>

        <b>Visa appointment fee and SEVIS fee:</b> After finishing the DS-160 form, the
        subsequent step is to pay the visa appointment fee at a designated bank. The SEVIS
        fee, a distinct payment, can be conveniently processed online. To fulfill this
        requirement, you must complete the 
        <a href="https://www.fmjfee.com/i901fee/index.html" target="_blank" class="post-url"><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i> I-901 form</a>
        and submit the SEVIS fee payment through that platform. Your essential SEVIS ID
        for this process is provided on your I-20 form.
        <br><br>

        <b>Visa appointment:</b> The next step is to schedule a visa appointment on the
        <a href="https://portal.ustraveldocs.com/" target="_blank" class="post-url"><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i> ustraveldocs</a>
        website, aiming for the closest available date. Checking the website is limited to
        three times daily, exceeding this limit may result in a 24-hour ban. In case you
        don't get a appointment date to satisfaction, apply for an emergency visa appointment.
        You will need to justify the emergency request with reasons such as potential program
        start date conflicts, funding loss, or accommodation challenges. Obtain a letter from
        your department affirming the urgency of your presence on campus before a specific
        date. Limited changes are allowed for emergency appointment dates.
        <br><br>

        <b>Prepare for visa interview:</b> Prepare for your visa interview by joining this Facebook group:
        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/nextop.usa/" target="_blank" class="post-url"><i class="fa-brands fa-facebook"></i> NexTop-USA (Higher study in USA)</a>,
        where you can learn from the experiences of others who have already undergone a visa
        interview. This group can provide valuable insights and tips to help you navigate your
        visa interview successfully. Pay close attention to the necessary documents you need to
        bring to the embassy to ensure a smooth process. Check out my notes for the visa interview:

        <br><br>

        <h3>Preparing for Your Departure</h3>

        <b>Connect with other Bangladeshi students:</b> Build connections with Bangladeshi students
        in the U.S. by reaching out and establishing a supportive network. Take the initiative to
        connect with individuals in your chosen city, seeking advice and forming relationships
        that can assist in navigating the academic and cultural landscape of the United States.
        These connections can be valuable in providing insights and support as you adjust to your
        new environment. Additionally, leverage these relationships for recommendations on
        accommodation, transportation, and local resources to enhance your overall experience.
        Platforms such as Facebook and LinkedIn offer excellent opportunities to connect with
        Bangladeshi students in your university.
        <br><br>

        <b>Find accommodation:</b> Conduct thorough research to identify suitable housing options
        that are in close proximity to your university. Look for accommodations that not only
        provide safety but also offer convenience in terms of accessibility to campus facilities.
        Consider factors such as transportation, amenities, and the overall neighborhood environment
        when evaluating different housing choices. This ensures that you find a living arrangement
        that not only meets your safety requirements but also enhances your overall university
        experience.
        <br><br>

        <b>Prepare for the trip:</b> Create a checklist for your trip, ensuring you pack important
        documents, appropriate clothing, and personal items. Double-check that you have all
        necessary travel documents, including your passport, visa, and any required forms. Pack
        weather-appropriate clothing and personal items such as toiletries and medications.
        Don't forget essentials like chargers, adapters, and any financial necessities. Explore
        the two lists presented below, which I created for my departure and adjust them as needed
        to suit your preferences or requirements.
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://abdussamiakanda.com/log?id=1679853664858" target="_blank" class="post-url"><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i> Things to carry from Bangladesh for USA</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://abdussamiakanda.com/log?id=1679853227053" target="_blank" class="post-url"><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i> Things to buy in USA</a></li>
        </ul>

        <b>Bonus tips:</b> Consider investing in durable luggage, especially since airport
        handling can be rough. The President brand in Bangladesh is known for high-quality
        luggage. Pack sturdy luggage and choose clothing suitable for your destination's
        weather conditions. If traveling in the fall, when temperatures are warmer, consider
        purchasing winter clothes upon arrival in the USA, as they may be more appropriate
        and cost-effective during the fall. Winter clothes bought in Bangladesh might not
        be suitable for the low temperatures in the USA.
        <br><br>

        

        Remember, this guide is just the beginning. Your journey will be filled with challenges
        and triumphs, each step contributing to your personal growth. Embrace the unknown, for
        within its complexities lie opportunities for learning and self-discovery.
