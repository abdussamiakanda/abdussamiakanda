        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <br>
        According to Jewish literature, all people are born into a core religious tradition that is described
        as their common heritage. This universal moral religion is regarded as obligatory for all of humanity<sup>[1]</sup>,
        irrespective of ancestry or particular covenant.

        <br><br>

        Throughout history, this religion has been identified by various names:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Yirat Shamayim (Hebrew: יִרְאַת שָׁמַיִם) - Fearers of Heaven<sup>[2]</sup>
          </li>
          <li>
            Ger Toshav (Hebrew: גֵּר תּוֹשָׁב) - Resident alien; non-Jews who accept the moral laws of the Torah<sup>[3]</sup>
          </li>
          <li>
            B'nei Noah (Hebrew: בְּנֵי נֹחַ) - Children of Noah (PBUH); righteous people who observe the Noahide laws<sup>[4]</sup>
          </li>
          <li>
            Theosebeia (Greek: Θεοσέβεια) - God-fearers; A term used during the Hellenistic period<sup>[5]</sup>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Association of This Universal Faith with Islam</h2>
        <br>
        According to the school of thought of Rabbi Elijah Benamozegh (1823-1900),
        this common faith corresponds to Islam. Benamozegh, in his work
        Israel and Humanity, argued that Islam preserves the essential principles of primordial
        monotheism - the same beliefs Judaism considers binding on all righteous non-Jews<sup>[6]</sup>.

        <br><br>

        Jewish literature also suggests that during the period of the Second Temple<sup>[7]</sup>, large
        numbers of non-Jewish believers would come to Jerusalem to offer the Kurban Shlamim
        (Peace Offering) alongside the Jewish people<sup>[8]</sup>. The terms Salami, Muslimi, or Muslime
        appear in some Jewish and Islamic historiographical interpretations as potential references to
        ancient monotheistic worshipers. These designations remain speculative and are not found in canonical
        Rabbinic texts but may reflect linguistic or cultural transmission of the root S-L-M (submission/peace).

        <br><br>

        <h2>Primordial Origins of Islam</h2>
        <br>
        The Qur'an itself acknowledges the existence of a primordial monotheistic faith, which is considered
        the original religion of humanity. This is evident in verses that refer to the religion of Abraham
        (PBUH)<sup>[9]</sup> and the religion of Noah (PBUH)<sup>[10]</sup>. The Qur'an also emphasizes
        the importance of following the teachings of the prophets, including Noah (PBUH), Abraham (PBUH),
        Moses (PBUH), and Jesus (PBUH), as part of a continuous divine revelation to humanity.

        <br><br>

        If Islam's foundations are equivalent to what Jewish thought designates as B'nei Noah, then Islam
        is not merely a religion that began in the 7th century CE. Rather, it represents a continuation of
        the religion of Noah (PBUH) - and, by extension, the religion of Adam (PBUH)<sup>[11]</sup>.

        <br><br>
        
        <h2>Historical Recognition of Kinship</h2>
        <br>
        The close relationship between Judaism and Islam was acknowledged by Biblical scholars and Jewish
        authorities for centuries. The Ten Lost Tribes of Israel, various Arab tribes, and groups
        like the Rechabites were recognized as communities that shared monotheistic beliefs and moral
        values with ancient Israel<sup>[12][13]</sup>.

        <br><br>

        This understanding remained largely unchallenged until the emergence of German revisionist scholars
        in the 19th century, including Julius Wellhausen and Adolph Büchler<sup>[14]</sup>. These academics
        introduced theories suggesting that Islam incorporated pagan elements such as moon worship, stone
        veneration, or asteroid cults<sup>[15]</sup>.

        <br><br>

        Such claims, however, have been increasingly refuted by both traditional religious scholars and modern
        historians<sup>[16]</sup>.

        <br><br>

        <h2>Jewish Law's Recognition of Islamic Monotheism</h2>
        <br>
        Halakha (Jewish law) holds that Muslims are recognized as perfect monotheists.
        Islamic theology affirms belief in the same singular, indivisible God recognized in Judaism.<sup>[17]</sup>

        <br><br>

        Maimonides (Rambam), in a letter to Obadiah the Proselyte (also in some editions/translations the Mishneh
        Torah), states explicitly:
        <br>
        "The Ishmaelites are not idol worshippers in the least, and [polytheism] has been long cut off from their mouths
        and their hearts, and they worship the singular God properly and without any blemish."<sup>[18]</sup>

        <br><br>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <br>
        The shared heritage of primordial monotheism between Islam and Judaism is a testament to the enduring
        nature of this faith. The recognition of a common moral code, the acknowledgment of righteous
        non-Jewish believers, and the historical connections between these two religions highlight the importance
        of understanding their shared roots.

        <br><br>

        This understanding fosters respect and dialogue between the two faiths, emphasizing the need for
        cooperation and mutual understanding in a world divided by religious differences.

These laws, given to the descendants of Noah, form the basis of a shared moral heritage beyond the Jewish covenant. Maimonides (Rambam), in Hilchot Melachim chapter 8, codifies these principles, emphasizing that non-Jews who observe them are considered righteous among the nations.

          <li>The Second Temple (516 BCE-70 CE) was the central place of worship in Jerusalem during a period when Jews and sympathetic non-Jews ("God-fearers" or Theosebeia) gathered for religious observance. Historical and Rabbinic sources note that many righteous Gentiles participated in Temple worship or supported Jewish practices during this era. <a href="https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.50a?lang=bi">Pesachim 50a</a> discusses the spiritual value of performing religious duties even without full understanding or pure intent, a principle later applied by Rabbinic commentators to explain why righteous Gentiles were welcomed in certain religious contexts. See also Louis Finkelstein's The Pharisees (Vol. 1, 1962), pp. 132-134.</li>
        
          <li>Kurban Shlamim is a type of sacrificial offering described in <a href="https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.3?lang=bi">Leviticus 3</a> and <a href="https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.7.11?lang=bi">Leviticus 7:11-21</a>. While primarily offered by Jews, certain traditions suggest that righteous Gentiles could also participate in peace offerings or bring donations to the Temple.</li>
        
          <li><a href="https://quran.com/2/135">Qur'an 2:135</a> mentions the "religion of Abraham" as a pure monotheistic tradition predating later religious divisions.</li>
        
          <li><a href="https://quran.com/4/163">Qur'an 4:163</a> affirms that Noah was among the prophets who received divine revelation, linking him to the continuous tradition of monotheism.</li>
        
          <li>While the Qur'an does not explicitly mention a "religion of Adam," Islamic and Jewish traditions describe Adam as the first human and the first monotheist, who received direct guidance from God. See <a href="https://quran.com/2/37">Qur'an 2:37</a> and <a href="https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2?lang=bi">Genesis 2</a> and <a href="https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.3?lang=bi">Genesis 3</a> for the shared Abrahamic narrative.</li>
        
          <li>Ten Lost Tribes of Israel refers to the Israelites exiled by the Assyrian conquest in the 8th century BCE. Some historical theories suggest descendants of these tribes integrated into various Middle Eastern communities, contributing to religious and cultural continuities. See <a href="https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/the-ten-lost-tribes">Jewish Virtual Library</a>.</li>
        
          <li>Rechabites is an ancient Israelite clan known for strict monotheism and ascetic practices, described in <a href="https://www.sefaria.org/Jeremiah.35?lang=bi">Jeremiah 35</a>. They are often cited as an example of righteous non-Israelites or proto-monotheistic groups respected in Biblical tradition.</li>
        
          <li><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Julius-Wellhausen">Julius Wellhausen</a> (1844-1918) was a German biblical scholar known for the Documentary Hypothesis and critical studies of Israelite and Islamic history. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_B%C3%BCchler">Adolph Büchler</a> (1867-1939) was a Jewish historian and theologian who contributed to the historical-critical study of Jewish texts and early Islamic history. Both scholars were influential figures in 19th-century revisionist biblical and Islamic studies.</li>
        
          <li>Wellhausen and others proposed that Islam's origins included elements of pre-Islamic paganism, such as the veneration of celestial bodies (moon worship) and sacred stones (e.g., the Black Stone in Mecca). These theories have been widely challenged by modern scholarship, which emphasizes the monotheistic continuity of early Islam.</li>
        
          <li>Fred Donner, Muhammad and the Believers (2010), and Islam and Its Past: Jahiliyya, Late Antiquity, and the Qur'an (Brill, 2017) offer alternative perspectives that emphasize the monotheistic and reformative nature of early Islam.</li>
        
          <li>Halakhic authorities, including medieval and modern scholars, affirm that Muslims are monotheists and not idolators (<a href="https://www.sefaria.org/Avodah_Zarah.2a?lang=bi">Avodah Zarah 2:1</a>; <a href="https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Foreign_Worship_and_Customs_of_the_Nations.11.4?lang=bi">Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Avodat Kochavim 11:4</a>). This view is based on the Islamic rejection of any form of idolatry and the affirmation of the singular, indivisible God.</li>

          <li>Maimonides, in his Letter to Obadiah the Proselyte, writes: “The Ishmaelites are not idol worshippers in the least, and [polytheism] has been long cut off from their mouths and their hearts, and they worship the singular God properly and without any blemish.” This reflects the consistent Halakhic position affirming Islamic monotheism.
