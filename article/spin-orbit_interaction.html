          <h3>Introduction</h3>

          In quantum physics, the spin-orbit interaction (also called spin-orbit
          effect or spin-orbit coupling) is a relativistic interaction of a particle's
          spin with its motion inside a potential. <br><br>

          A key example of this phenomenon is the spin-orbit interaction leading to
          shifts in an electron's atomic energy levels, due to electromagnetic
          interaction between the electron's magnetic dipole, its orbital motion,
          and the electrostatic field of the positively charged nucleus. This
          phenomenon is detectable as a splitting of spectral lines, which can be
          thought of as a Zeeman effect product of two relativistic effects: the
          apparent magnetic field seen from the electron perspective and the magnetic
          moment of the electron associated with its intrinsic spin. A similar effect,
          due to the relationship between angular momentum and the strong nuclear
          force, occurs for protons and neutrons moving inside the nucleus, leading
          to a shift in their energy levels in the nucleus shell model. In the field
          of spintronics, spin-orbit effects for electrons in semiconductors and other
          materials are explored for technological applications. The spin-orbit
          interaction is one cause of magnetocrystalline anisotropy and the spin Hall effect.

          <h3>Relativistic origin of the Spin-Orbit Interaction</h3>

          According to the theory of relativity, a particle moving in an electrical
          field experiences an effective magnetic field, which is directed perpendicularly
          to the electrical field and the particle movement direction. The interaction of
          this effective magnetic field with the electron spin is called Spin-Orbit
          interaction. It is important to emphasize that the direction and magnitude
          of the effective magnetic field do not depend either on the particle charge
          or on the particle spin. <br><br>

          According to this theory, the electric and magnetic field mutually
          transformed into each other depending on the speed of an observer. For
          example, if in a coordinate system of static observer there is only a
          magnetic field, a movable observer will experience this field as both
          an electrical field and a magnetic field. <br><br>

          A particle moving in a static magnetic field experience an effective
          electric field. The effective electrical field acts on the particle
          charge (the Lorentz force, Hall effect) and forces the particle to move
          along this field. <br><br>

          A particle moving in a static electrical field experience an effective
          magnetic field. The effective magnetic field acts on the particle magnetic
          moment (spin-orbit interaction) and causes the precession of the magnetic
          moment around the direction of the effective magnetic field. <br><br>

          The electromagnetic field is a relativistic object and the Lorentz
          transformation equations are written as,

          $$\mathbf{E}_\mathrm{move} = \frac{\mathbf{E}_\mathrm{static} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{H}_\mathrm{static}}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \qquad \text{;} \qquad \mathbf{H}_\mathrm{move} = \frac{\mathbf{H}_\mathrm{static} - \frac{\mathbf{v}}{c^2} \times \mathbf{E}_\mathrm{static}}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$

          where, $\mathbf{E}_\mathrm{static}, \mathbf{H}_\mathrm{static}$ are the electric and magnetic field in the static coordinate system and $\mathbf{E}_\mathrm{move}, \mathbf{H}_\mathrm{move}$ are the elctric and magnetic field in the coordinate system, which moves with a constant velocity $\mathbf{v}$.

          As a result, an electron, which moves in a static magnetic field
          $\mathbf{H}_\text{static}$, experiences in own reference frame an
          effective electrical field $\mathbf{E}_\text{Hall}$, which is called
          the Hall field (Hall voltage). Similarly, when an electron moves in a
          static electrical field $\mathbf{E}_\text{static}$, it experiences in
          own reference frame an effective magnetic field $\mathbf{H}_\text{SO}$,
          which is called the effective spin-orbit magnetic field. <br><br>

          For example, when an electron moves in the $x$-direction,
          $$v_x \neq 0 \qquad \text{;} \qquad v_y = 0 \qquad \text{;} \qquad v_z = 0$$

          the effective electric field and the effective magnetic field are,
          $$E_\text{Hall} = E_\text{y} = - \frac{v}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} H_\text{z} \qquad \text{;} \qquad H_\text{SO} = H_\text{y} = \frac{\frac{v}{c^2}}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} E_\text{z}$$

          For the non-relativistic case $(v << c)$:
          $$\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \simeq 1$$

          The effective electric field and the effective magnetic field are then,
          $$E_\text{Hall} = E_\text{y} = - v H_\text{z} \qquad \text{;} \qquad H_\text{SO} = H_\text{y} = \frac{v}{c^2} E_\text{z}$$

          <strong>Question:</strong> An electron always moves along the electrical
          field (but not perpendicularly). Then, how it can experience the spin-orbit
          interaction? <br>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> The trajectory of an electron may be very different.
          There are many cases when an electron moves perpendicularly to an electrical
          field. For example, when the electron is orbiting around a nucleus. <br><br>

          <strong>Question:</strong> Which parameter characterizes the spin-orbit
          interaction? Is it a classical parameter or a quantum mechanical parameter?
          <br>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> There is only one cause of spin-orbit interaction.
          It is the magnetic field $\mathbf{H}_\text{SO}$. All other parameters are
          consequences of $\mathbf{H}_\text{SO}$. For example, the electron spin
          aligns itself along $\mathbf{H}_\text{SO}$. It changes the energy of the
          electron. The change in energy can be defined as the energy of the
          spin-orbit interaction $E_\text{SO}$. If an additional external magnetic
          field $\mathbf{H}_\text{ext}$ is applied, the electron spin is aligned along
          the total magnetic field $\mathbf{H}_\text{SO} + \mathbf{H}_\text{ext}$ and
          $E_\text{SO}$ has no physical meaning. <br><br>

          <strong>Question:</strong> Since the spin-orbit magnetic field
          $\mathbf{H}_\text{SO}$ is proportional to $1/c^2$, then it should
          be negligibly small. Should we care about such a tiny effect? <br>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> Yes. It is small, except for when
          $\mathbf{E}_\text{static}$ is huge. For example, near the nucleus
          $\mathbf{H}_\text{SO}$ is large. Any substantial spin-orbit interaction
          is induced only by an electrical field of a nucleus. Other realistic
          sources of the electrical field in a solid induce very weak spin-orbit
          interaction. This field is very symmetric, and it cancels itself out in
          a nucleus. External fields may break this symmetry. <br><br>

          <strong>Question:</strong> Is spin-orbit interaction is a quantum
          mechanical effect?<br>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> No. The spin-orbit interaction affects both small
          and large objects. It exists in the macro world as well.<br><br>

          More to be done...
